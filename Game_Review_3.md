## Summary

Little Nightmares is a puzzle adventure game following a small unspoken being that is the playable character for the game. You wake up in a suitcase in what looks like a small cave or hideaway space that the character you’re playing obviously lives in. The game follows a pattern similar to linear platform games, for the most part you go along a singular path in the game and the most you can stray from it is if you go inside a small hole in the wall that serves as a checkpoint or explore the rooms adjacent to where you are to collect items. 

The thing that keeps the game running and intriguing though is how you step through the rooms and levels. Every room or area in the game can be equated to a level, and in each level you have a set of puzzles to complete so that you can progress. It starts out easy with small puzzles, like pulling a plank off of a door or climbing a rope of clothes through an open window, and then it progresses to harder puzzles like dodging different monsters and cooks and distracting them so you can make a run for it. All throughout the game the puzzles change as you try and make your way through wherever it is you are. 

As well as doing these puzzles to progress, you learn a story as your step through the levels as well. You slowly get to realize that you are a smaller than usual being, we can infer we are a child who is severely malnourished, and that you seem to be on some boat or ship, which we gather from the swaying and tipping motions of the screen during the entire game. Eventually we get outside of the boat and see it loading more of these hideous creatures that we have been dodging and we later get to a scene showing us we are in what looks like a maw and that these creatures are workers and guests on this structure in the water. 

Closer to the end of the game you start to discover new things, we see the main character progressively get hungrier and hungrier, leading it to eat a rat, and we see a new character introduced as what we deduce to be the main villain or antagonist of the game. Through the last parts of the game we are trying to learn as much as we can about this villain and avoid her at all costs, though in some areas we have to sneak around her to complete puzzles. We finally get to the end of the game where we have to defeat this antagonist with mirrors, she’s masked and we can see she doesn’t see beauty in herself and is ashamed of her face so the use of mirrors to present her face to her hurts her and brings light to the room which defeats her in the end. But here is where the game took an interesting turn, after we defeat the woman we see the character we are playing walk over to her body and we seem to suck this dark light or magic out of the woman. We exit the room and we are at the bottom of this incredibly tall staircase with side characters lining the hall. We walk slowly up the staircase and we hear a change in music, it goes from heroic to menacing, from light and simple music to dark and complex music. 

As we walk the character sucks this same dark light or magic from everything in its path, killing everything and everyone. It is revealed here that the character we have been playing and protecting and helping reach the end is in fact the antagonist and villain of the entire game, we have been playing on the side of evil. It was such an unexpected turn of events and with the end of the game we are able to piece together the story and the missing pieces and see how things finally add up now that we have this final piece of the puzzle that we played.

## Final Thoughts

This game had lots of very subtle hints spread throughout it, that when seen singularly don’t quite tell you the end result of the game but when you look at them all together after the game they all make sense. It suddenly makes sense why the children were afraid of you, why the creatures seemed to be searching for you, why you ate rats and eventually your friendly gnome companions. I loved how the game made you fall in love with the character and protect it and care for it just to show you that the person you were helping was evil to start with. It’s a mechanic I wanted to see in a game for years and was finally able to see play out and I think it’s one of the things that made me fall so in love with this game. 

Another few things that made the game stand out to me were the subtle references that hinted at the menacing nature of the game. There’s this one scene where you jump out of a vent and into a room that’s filled feet high with shoes, just shoes. It’s a small reference to the Holocaust and how the Nazis took shoes from their captees that would show just how many people were killed. To see this many shoes showed the player the same thing, just how many beings were killed in this game. There’s nothing special about the room, it was probably an empty storage room for all we knew. But landing in it and seeing the pile and seeing shoes actively drop from the sky was a really dark moment and a reference to a really dark event that completely changed the tone of the game once you reached it and realized it’s meaning. 

I liked the puzzles throughout the game as well, they for the most part were easy to figure out but there were some that took a moment to click for me and it made it fell more challenging which I love to see in a game, it shows the developers weren’t just making random tasks but that they put thought into how difficult their game would be and that they wanted to challenge the players and keep them intrigued. 

The story of the game was a little hard to put together until the end and even then I had to watch videos that showed the connections between everything. There were probably a few ways that the story could’ve been made a little clearer than it was, I think the hints they gave us were subtle but most people got them. I just don’t know if making the hints more obvious would’ve ruined the integrity of the game or given away the ending too soon. 

I think if anything I would’ve wanted to see more about the evil character we played, I want to know more about the nature of the character and why it is so feared and what exactly it does, and how it uses the powers it stole from the others. The DLC for the game showed a different perspective, it was from a small child’s point of view and really explained a lot of questions about the surroundings of the game or why some things were the way they were, there just wasn’t any explanation about the played character. It was an incredibly thought out and well put together game and I loved playing it, I just hope that the second one explains some of the questions we had from the first. Other than those leftover questions, I loved everything about this game and how it plays and where you ended up with it.
