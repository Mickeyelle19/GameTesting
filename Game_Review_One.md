## Summary

Welcome to the Game is a psychological thriller style game that casts you as the main player, a hacker in a small apartment with horrible lighting and security. Your goal throughout the game is to search the dark web for secrets which will give you a code when they are completed correctly. To finish the game you need to find eight of these codes, this gives you the url to a red room, a room where you watch and participate in live murder and torture, though the game does not actually show this, and consequently you win the game.

Aside from trying to find the secrets, you should be prepared for random attacks from other hackers on the dark web. When these occur the game gives you ‘hacking challenges’ to test your skills and reflexes. Successfully complete the challenges and you can carry on hacking, fail and kidnappers will come to your apartment. You don’t necessarily need to fail a challenge for the kidnappers to come find you though, they are a constant threat throughout the game and you have to keep a careful eye and ear out for them and hide or your game instantly ends. Playing through the game is pretty interesting. You know you’re in a horror type situation and yet it feels calm, this is where the psychological part of it comes in. You can easily get sidetracked by looking for the secrets or even figuring them out once you’ve found them and forget to check for the kidnapper. 

There’s many things to keep track of during the game so it constantly keeps you occupied and alert. Throughout the game you are trying to find 8 secrets, to find them you have to go through all of the different websites on the dark web and press and do everything you can on those sites. The secrets that lead you to the code have been as obvious as submitting a confession on a church’s site or as complicated and clicking on the circles in a site’s patterns and turning them the correct ways. The websites have a wide variety of topics and some are slightly disturbing, others are suggestive, and others are simple and sweet with a dark twist. These small tasks and secrets are in addition to hacking challenges and looking out for kidnappers. If one approaches you need to quickly turn out all the lights and hide from them, the computer will read your microphone activity during this mechanic and the kidnappers will find you if you make any noises. 

The hacking challenges are a really simple yet really fun part of the game, there are a few challenges that appear but the difficulty varies based on how many codes you have, the time in the game, and how long you have been playing. You have a task such as completing a pattern, finishing a path from one end of the screen to another, copying sentences, and clicking items at a precise time. After completing the challenges, finding all of the codes, avoiding the kidnappers, and getting the url, you finally are led to the red room, oddly enough making it here gives you a real sense of accomplishment for all the hard work you put into the game. I haven’t made it to this part of the game personally but from what I have heard there isn’t anything graphic shown so the game is still suitable to play for those who are light of heart. 

## Final Thoughts

There are many mechanics to this game that I loved, and some that I still loved because of how fun they made the game but they could use some work. The first being finding the secrest, which is the main part of the game. Like I described earlier you have to do a lot and click a lot of things to find these codes. I think that with this mechanic you are never bored and very intrigued to keep going and figure it all out but at the same time it can get a little tedious clicking on every single thing on every single website. Because of this mechanic the game play is drawn out and it takes at least a couple of hours to get all of the codes, and this is in addition to hacking challenges and looking out for kidnappers. 

The mechanic of the kidnappers is probably my favorite one. The game casts you as the main player, you are quite literally sat at your computer finding these codes. The only part of the game where you are immersed is when you have to go throughout the house turning off lights and hiding from the kidnappers. And yet the game still found a way to pull you into the game with this mechanic. As you are turning out lights and hiding, the game turns on your microphone and uses any sounds it picks up to determine if and how quickly you are found. If you are mostly quiet then the kidnappers will veer in your direction but most of the time leave you alone. If you are loud and make noises the kidnappers find you instantly and end you game. And if you are quiet the game rewards you by letting you continue the game without being found. It’s really interesting how they incorporated you into the gameplay in this scenario and it makes hiding time all the more stressful and fun.

The last mechanic I found noteworthy were the hacking challenges, these challenges are a very favored part of the game by many. They’re not too challenging but they’re fun, and they pop up at seemingly random times so they catch you off guard which throws you off just a little bit before you even start the challenge. They have a wide variety of tasks and switch them up on you so you don’t have to do the same task over and over, the difficulty varies, and any time you come across a new puzzle it explains very simply what to do which is appreciated to many new players. I also liked that it incorporated typing which makes you feel more in the role of a hacker, it requires typing skills but not heavily so those who aren’t great at typing still have fun and complete these challenges. 

Overall, this game is a really fun and great find. I found it through a Markiplier Let’s Play on Youtube and downloaded it instantly since it seemed right up my alley. I can’t count how many countless hours I have put into this game or how many hours I’ve watched others play this game. I still haven’t reached the end but I keep trying, the game pulls you back time after time and keeps you interested the entire time. It was a great idea and a great execution in my opinion and aside from how tedious or long it can be it was an amazing game.
